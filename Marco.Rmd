# Question 2 Blood fat concentration (11 marks)

(a) (6 marks) Conduct a two-independent sample $t$-test using R to determine whether the concentration of plasma cholesterol is significantly different between patients with no evidence of heart disease and those with narrowing of the arteries.

    **Answer:**

    1.  $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ against $H_A:  \mu_1 \ne  \mu_2$

        where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the population means of plasma cholesterol concentrations in patients with no evidence of heart disease and those with narrowing of the arteries respectively.

    2.  the test statistic is t = -3.7357

    3.  the sampling distribution is $t_{df=75}$.

    4.  p-value = 0.0003641 \< 0.01.

    5.  Reject $H_0$ at the 1% significance level.

    6.  Therefore, we conclude that the population means of plasma cholesterol concentrations in patients with no evidence of heart disease and those with narrowing of the arteries are significantly different.

    ```{r include=FALSE}
    #No Disease
    mean1 <- 195.2745
    var1 <- 1303.9231
    n1 <- 51

    #Disease
    mean2 <- 216.1906
    var2 <- 1850.2488
    n2 <- 320
    ```

    ```{r}
    #calculate t and df
    t_stat <- (mean1 - mean2)/sqrt(var1/n1 + var2/n2)
    df <- (var1/n1 + var2/n2)^2 / ((var1/n1)^2/(n1-1) + (var2/n2)^2/(n2-1))

    #calculate P_val
    p_val <- 2 * pt(-abs(t_stat), df)
    ```

(b) (3 marks) Determine a 99% confidence interval for the mean difference in concentration of plasma cholesterol between the two groups of patients.

    **Answer:**

    A 99% confidene interval for the mean difference in concentration of plasma cholesterol between the two groups of patients can be given as:

    (-35.7164, -6.1158)

    With the mean_difference = -20.9161, standard_error = 5.5990, critical t_value = 2.6434 and same degrees of freedom from (a), at df = 74.5745 \~ 75.

    ```{r}
    # Calculate the mean difference
    mean_diff <- mean1 - mean2

    # Calculate the standard error of the difference
    se_diff <- sqrt(var1/n1 + var2/n2)

    # Find critical t-value for 99% confidence interval (two sided)
    t_crit <- qt(0.995, df)

    # Calculate the margin of error
    margin_error <- t_crit * se_diff

    # Calculate the confidence interval
    lower_ci <- mean_diff - margin_error
    upper_ci <- mean_diff + margin_error
    ```

(c) (2 marks) Explain the correspondence between the confidence interval in (b) and a test of the hypotheses you listed in question (a).

    **Answer:**

    Since the confidence interval does not contain zero, this aligns with rejecting the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level in question (a).

    The confidence interval is entirely negative, meaning that the mean plasma cholesterol concentration in the group with no heart disease is lower than the mean in the group with narrowing of arteries. The magnitude of the difference falling between 6.12 and 35.72 units with 99% confidence.

    The fact that zero is not in the interval corresponds directly to the p-value (0.0003641) being less than 0.01, both leading to the same conclusion of rejecting $H_0$.

# Question 3 Regression (31 marks)

(d) (4 marks) Fit a regression model to the transformed $M_2$ model. Present the appropriate scatterplot and plot the fitted line onto the scatterplot. Does the transformed line regression model $M_2$ seem to fit the data well? Comment about the output in a few concise sentences.

    **Answer:**

    ```{r include=FALSE}
    #model M_2
    log_Time = log(glakes$Time)
    sqrt_Tonnage = sqrt(glakes$Tonnage)
    glakes_lm_2 <- lm(log_Time~sqrt_Tonnage, data = glakes)
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    #plot transformed M_2 model
    ggplot(data = glakes) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sqrt_Tonnage, y = log_Time)) +
      geom_abline(intercept = coef(glakes_lm_2)[1], slope = coef(glakes_lm_2)[2], color = "red", linewidth = 1) +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
      labs(title = "",
           x = "sqrt(Tonnage)", 
           y = "Log(Time)")
    ```

(e) (5 marks) Provide the model summary and diagnostics checking plots for model $M_2.$ Does the straight line regression model $M_2$ seem to fit the data well? Comment about the output in a few concise sentences.

    **Answer:**

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    #model summary
    summary(glakes_lm_2)
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    # diagnostics checing plots
    par(mfrow = c(2,2))
    plot(glakes_lm_2)
    ```

    (4 marks) Perform a hypothesis testing for a positive slope at a significance level of 5% based on model $M_2.$

    **Answer:**

    1.  $H_0: \beta_1 \le 0$ against $H_A:  \beta_1 >  0$

        where $\beta_1$ is the slope of the model $M_2$. Note that the alternative hypothesis is one sided.

    2.  The test statistic (from R output as shown in question (e):

        $$
        t = \frac{\hat{\beta}-0}{se(\hat{\beta})}=\frac{0.021514}{0.001909}=11.27
        $$

    3.  The sampling distribution for the test statistic t is $t_{df=(n-2)}$ that is $t_{df=31-2=29}$.

    4.  The p-value = P($t_{29}$ \> 11.27) = 2.048434e-12 (see below)

        ```{r}
        pt(11.27, 29, lower.tail=FALSE)
        ```

    5.  Decision. Given the p-value is kess than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.

    6.  Conslusion. Therefore, we conclude that the slope is statistically significantly positive.

(f) (6 marks) Compare a 95% confidence interval of the mean response and a 95% prediction interval for a new value when Tonnage = 10,000 using the untransformed model $M_1$ and transformed model $M_2$ respectively. Provide two scatterplots that consist the fitted model, the confidence and prediction intervals for each of $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively. Comment about the output in a few concise sentences.
